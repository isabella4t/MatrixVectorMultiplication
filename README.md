## Methods

firsttest: largely used for when I was debugging the original matrix multiplication code

testnum: takes a array length and the number of non zero ints and prints the time it takes to multiply

multiply: takes two double int arrays and returns the matrix multiplication of the two

fill: takes an array and a number of non zeros and puts that number of non zero ints into the array
